<em>This Battleship application lets you strategically place 5 ships on a grid and take turns with an AI opponent to try to sink eachothers fleet. It features a user-friendly drag and drop interface that allows you to click a ship once placed to rotate it. Alternatively, you can click the randomize button to generate your ships positions at random.</em>

This application is a part of The Odin Projects Full-Stack Javascript curriculum and was developed with the purpose of integrating unit testing into my workflow. The main challenges I faced were learning how to use the HTML drag & drop API, apply TDD methodologies, adopt static typing, and implement the MVC architectural design pattern.
