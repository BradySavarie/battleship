<em>This Battleship app lets you strategically place 5 ships on a grid and take turns with an AI opponent to try to sink eachothers fleet. It features a user-friendly drag and drop interface that allows you to click a ship once placed to rotate it. Alternatively, you can click the randomize button to generate your ships positions automatically.</em>
